Note about the archive files specifically.

These files consist of test programs for Arduino IDE, Eclipse and Atmel Studio Framework. They are mainly based on example code from ASF, along with some original work by Tony@think3dprint3d.com. Where not specified they are licensed under the GPL v3.0 (but the vast majority has specified licenses from ASP or elsewhere).

Quite a lot of these programs and bits of code were designed to work on older versions of the DUET and may not work with the current version.
